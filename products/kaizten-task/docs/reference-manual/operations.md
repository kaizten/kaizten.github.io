The main feature of Kaizten Task is to execute Docker containers. 

A Docker container can include any software component. Some illustrative examples can be:
* A Python script to transform a CSV file into a JSON file.
* A Java artifact (JAR) to calculate the shortest path to reach a node into a graph.
* A C++ program that performs image processing to detect borders.
* A Rust command-line tool that ingests large log files, performs fast parallel parsing, and emits compact summary reports (JSON).
* An R script that runs statistical analyses and produces charts (PNG/PDF) and CSV result files for downstream consumption.
